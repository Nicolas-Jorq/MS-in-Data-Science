## Optimizing Retail Forecasting: Capturing Cyclical Trends with Advanced SARIMA Models

### Objectives and Scope
The paper focuses on the challenges of time series forecasting in retail, particularly for predicting trends or cycles, aiming to enhance the prediction of such trends through advanced SARIMA models. The paper uses daily sales data from a Superstore as a case study.

### Methods
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The paper starts with extensive EDA to understand the data, its distributions, correlations, and outliers.
2. **Time Series Analysis**: The paper employs ARIMA and SARIMA models for time series forecasting. It also conducts tests for stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller test.
3. **Model Evaluation**: AIC and BIC are used as criteria for model selection, and residuals are analyzed for model effectiveness.

### Key Findings
1. **Inherent Weekly Patterns**: The models that paid attention to weekly cycles in the data performed the best.
2. **Data Transformation**: Log transformation and outlier handling significantly improved the performance of the models.
3. **Model Complexity**: Adding complexity to the models did not necessarily improve performance.

### Applications and Implications
1. **Inventory Management**: Improved forecasting models can help in better inventory management.
2. **Promotions and Staffing**: Reliable forecasts can lead to better planning for promotions and staffing.

## Conclusion
- Successfully improved forecasting models and provided valuable insights for retail store managers, especially in inventory management and strategic planning.
- Outlines areas for future research.
