## Optimizing Retail Forecasting: Capturing Cyclical Trends with Advanced SARIMA Models

### Objectives and Scope
The paper focuses on the challenges of time series forecasting in retail, particularly for predicting trends or cycles, aiming to enhance the prediction of such trends through advanced SARIMA models. The paper uses daily sales data from a Superstore as a case study.

### Methods
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The paper starts with extensive EDA to understand the data, its distributions, correlations, and outliers.
2. **Time Series Analysis**: The paper employs ARIMA and SARIMA models for time series forecasting. It also conducts tests for stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller test.
3. **Model Evaluation**: AIC and BIC are used as criteria for model selection, and residuals are analyzed for model effectiveness.

### Key Findings
1. **Inherent Weekly Patterns**: The models that paid attention to weekly cycles in the data performed the best.
2. **Data Transformation**: Log transformation and outlier handling significantly improved the performance of the models.
3. **Model Complexity**: Adding complexity to the models did not necessarily improve performance.

### Applications and Implications
1. **Inventory Management**: Improved forecasting models can help in better inventory management.
2. **Promotions and Staffing**: Reliable forecasts can lead to better planning for promotions and staffing.

### Conclusion
- Successfully improved forecasting models and provided valuable insights for retail store managers, especially in inventory management and strategic planning.
- Outlines areas for future research.


## Time Series Analysis Foundation
### ARIMA Modeling - ACF, PACF Analysis
- Introduces AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial AutoCorrelation Function (PACF) as essential tools for understanding the time dependencies in time-series data.
- Explains how ACF and PACF plots are used to identify the order of the ARIMA model, providing a foundational step in time-series forecasting.

### ARIMA Modeling - Differencing
- Covers the concept of differencing as a method to stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, thus eliminating trend and seasonality.
- Discusses the various types of differencing (first-order, seasonal, etc.) and their applications in making a series stationary for effective modeling.

### ARIMA Modeling - Statistical Estimations
- Focuses on the statistical methods used to estimate the parameters of an ARIMA model, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
- Discusses how these estimations influence the model's forecasting accuracy and what considerations must be made to ensure a robust model.

### Stationary Process Analysis
- Emphasizes the importance of stationarity in time-series analysis and how it affects the predictive power of ARIMA models.
- Explores various statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to determine whether a time series is stationary or not.
