# Machine Learning

### I. Introduction
- Aimed to develop a machine learning model for classifying credit scores into three categories: Good, Poor, and Standard. Leveraged various machine learning algorithms to identify the most suitable approach for credit score classification and offer valuable insights for financial institutions.
  
### II. Related Work
- Reviewed existing statistical and machine learning approaches for credit scoring, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ensemble methods, highlighting their advantages and limitations.

### III. Solution
- Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier algorithms and evaluated their performance using classification reports. Conducted hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize these algorithms further.

### IV. Comparison
- Analyzed the performance of different machine learning algorithms, focusing on their susceptibility to overfitting, ability to handle noise, and adaptability to imbalanced class distributions. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier generally outperformed Decision Trees in terms of F1-score and accuracy.

### V. Future Directions
- Discussed potential directions for future work, including the implementation of Neural Networks, leveraging domain knowledge for feature engineering, and exploring regression models for more nuanced credit score prediction.

### VI. Conclusion
- Concluded that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier showed better performance than the Decision Tree algorithm in classifying credit scores. Identified areas for improvement such as feature engineering, data augmentation, and model complexity, aiming to achieve even better model performance in the future.
