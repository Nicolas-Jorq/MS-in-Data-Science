# Statistical Methods

### Exploring Financial Indicators
- A comprehensive analysis of four random variables: daily ETF return, daily relative change in the price of crude oil, daily relative change in the gold price, and daily return of the JPMorgan Chase & Co stock. 
- Utilizes Python for statistical analysis, covering correlation, distributions, hypothesis testing, and linear regression.

### Introduction: Meeting the Data
- Provides an initial look at four financial variables, calculating and comparing their sample means and standard deviations.
- Investigates the correlation between these variables using Pearson Correlation Coefficient and heat maps.

### Methodology: Describing the Data
- Employs Python's statistical packages for data analysis, focusing on data distribution and patterns.
- Visualizes data distributions using histograms and time series plots, highlighting the skewness in the data.

### Data Distribution Assumptions
- Assumes that the four variables are normally distributed, confirming this with Shapiro-Wilk Tests for normality.
- Explores the Central Limit Theorem by taking both random and sequential samples, discussing the implications on data distribution.

### Statistical Results: Hypothesis Testing & Confidence Intervals
- Conducts various hypothesis tests, including Z-tests and T-tests, to determine if the sample means are significantly different from a given value.
- Calculates 95% confidence intervals for the ETF variable, comparing the intervals based on different sample sizes.

### Linear Regression Model Analysis
- Builds a linear regression model using ETF and gold variables, assessing the model's fit and assumptions through Pearson Coefficients and adjusted R2 score.
- Tests the model's assumptions of linearity, constant variance, and normal distribution of error terms, drawing conclusions on its applicability.

### Model Performance and Prediction
- Extends the linear regression model to include multiple variables, evaluating its predictive power through an adjusted R2 score.
- Assesses the model's suitability by checking various statistical assumptions, emphasizing the importance of model validation in statistical analysis.

### Appendix
- Contains in-depth code and methodologies for each part of the report, serving as a reference for the statistical tests and analyses conducted.
